Chester Square Neighbors is an association dedicated to bring together everyone who lives or works in their neighborhood. Their goals are to share information with one another, promote health and safety, and create an overall welcoming environment. The organization seeks to revitalize Massachusetts Avenue and transform it into a premiere destination for residents and tourists alike.

Our group specifically analyzed public transportation options. We hope our work will contribute to the ongoing conversations about the importance of investing in sound transportation infrastructure. A few of our broad motivating questions include:

- What public transportation options are available in the area?
- Are the current transit systems safe and reliable?
- How many people use public transportation?
